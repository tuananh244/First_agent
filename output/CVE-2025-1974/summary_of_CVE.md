## 1. Summary:
The Ingress-NGINX controller had a path traversal vulnerability in the `auth` annotation parser.  By crafting a malicious Ingress resource, an attacker could control the filename of the authentication password file. This allowed writing password files outside of the intended directory. The fix ensures filename safety by verifying that the file path stays within the intended directory.

## 2. Analysis:

- **Why the vulnerability existed:** The vulnerability arose because the `auth` annotation parser in `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go` was constructing the authentication password file name using `fmt.Sprintf` without proper sanitization or validation.  The file name was based on the Ingress and Secret names and UIDs, but lacked checks preventing directory traversal. An attacker could manipulate these names to include "../" sequences.
- **Affected Code:**
    - `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go`: This file contains the vulnerable logic for parsing authentication annotations and creating the password file. Specifically, the `Parse` function was affected.
- **How an attacker could exploit it:** An attacker could create an Ingress resource and a corresponding secret with carefully crafted names containing path traversal characters (e.g., ".."). This would result in the password file being written to a location outside the intended `authDirectory`.  An attacker could then potentially overwrite sensitive files or gain unauthorized access.
- **How the patch mitigates the issue:**
    - The patch in `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go` addresses the vulnerability by using `filepath.Join` to construct the full path, followed by checks to ensure the constructed path remains within the designated `authDirectory`. It also validates that the filename contains no directory components. This prevents path traversal by disallowing password files outside the intended directory.
    - A new `MaliciousRegex` was added to `internal/ingress/annotations/parser/validators.go` to prevent CRLF injection. This is used to validate values to prevent response splitting.
    - The template was modified in `internal/ingress/controller/template/template.go` to quote strings to prevent command injection.
    - Upgraded golang in images to address security vulnerabilities.
