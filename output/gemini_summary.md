1. **Summary:**
The Ingress-NGINX controller was vulnerable to a path traversal in the `auth` annotation parsing. This allowed writing authentication files to arbitrary locations within the `authDirectory`, potentially overwriting critical files. The patch prevents this by validating the generated password file path. Additionally, a CRLF injection vulnerability was fixed by adding a `MaliciousRegex` to filter out `\r` and `\n` from annotation values.

2. **Analysis:**

**Path Traversal in `auth` annotation:**

- **Why:** The vulnerability existed because the `auth` annotation parser (in `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go`) constructed the password file path using `fmt.Sprintf` with the `authDirectory` configured in the Ingress controller and components of the Ingress and Secret objects. This construction was vulnerable to path traversal if the namespace, Ingress UID, or Secret UID contained malicious characters (e.g., ".."). No input sanitization of namespace, Ingress UID and Secret UID was done.

- **Affected Code:** `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go`, specifically the `Parse` function. The vulnerable line was: `passFilename := fmt.Sprintf("%v/%v-%v-%v.passwd", a.authDirectory, ing.GetNamespace(), ing.UID, secret.UID)`. This line is replaced by safe path generation using `filepath.Join`.
    - The generated `passFileName` and `passFilePath` is then validated to prevent path traversal by checking that `a.authDirectory` and `filepath.Dir(passFilePath)` are the same and `passFileName` and `filepath.Base(passFilePath)` are the same.

- **Exploitation:** An attacker could create a namespace, ingress, and secret with UIDs or names containing `..` sequences. When the Ingress controller processed the `auth` annotation, the resulting `passFilename` would include the path traversal, leading to file writes outside the intended `authDirectory`.

- **Mitigation:** The patch in `internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go` mitigates the vulnerability by constructing the file path using `filepath.Join` and validating the resulting path. It checks if the directory part of the constructed file path is the same as the configured `authDirectory` and the filename is the same as the base name. This ensures the generated file path remains within the intended directory, preventing path traversal.

**CRLF Injection:**

- **Why:** Input values received from annotations were not properly validated for carriage returns (`\r`) or newlines (`\n`). An attacker could craft a malicious annotation value containing these characters to inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to request smuggling or other HTTP-related vulnerabilities.

- **Affected Code:** `internal/ingress/annotations/parser/validators.go`, `internal/ingress/annotations/customheaders/main.go`

- **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject CRLF sequences into custom headers using a crafted Ingress manifest.

- **Mitigation:** The patch in `internal/ingress/annotations/parser/validators.go` introduces a new regex `MaliciousRegex` which blocks carriage return and new line characters in annotation values via the `ValidateRegex` func. This effectively prevents the injection of CRLF sequences, mitigating the risk of request smuggling or other header-based attacks. Additionally, test cases that made use of `allow-snippet-annotations` were disabled to mitigate CVE-2025-1974.
